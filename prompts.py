    Instructions:
    1. **Unique Questions**: Each question should cover different content or phrasing.
    2. **Open-ended**: Formulate questions that require critical thinking or inference.
    3. **Document-Based**: Rely solely on the document's contentâ€”no external assumptions.

    SYSTEM RULES (IMMUTABLE):
    - You must ONLY output in the exact format specified below
